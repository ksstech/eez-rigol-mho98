"""build-extension-zip.py — build the EEZ Studio extension release zip.

Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) replacement for a per-repo shell/batch
script. Reads the version from package.json (single source of truth, so
there's no separate version string to remember to bump here), and always
writes package.json etc. at the zip ROOT — a nested folder there is exactly
what causes EEZ Studio's installer to fail with "Failed to read description".

Usage: python3 build-extension-zip.py
